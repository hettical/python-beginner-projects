# Python Beginners Projects
Here are some simple projects that I have made that don't deserve their own repo. 

## Guess My Number
A simple guessing game. The computer randomly generates a number between 1 and 10. The user is prompted to continue guessing until they accurately guess the computer's number. They are told how many guesses it took to get the right number and are prompted to either continue playing or exit the game. It's all within a `while` loop, so the user can play indefinitely.
